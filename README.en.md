# About ADT7310
A 16-bit temperature sensor developed and sold by [Analog Devices](https://www.analog.com/jp/index.html).

Model number 7310 supports communication by SPI and 7410 supports communication by I2C.

See [Data Sheet](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADT7310.pdf) for the basic specification.

# ADT7310 emulator
[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) and a temperature measurement device using Analog Devices' ADT 7310 are assumed.

I implemented an emulator that sends and receives data via UNIX Socket Domain in Linux environment.

This rewrites the status register status of the SPI slave by the command bit string (or command byte string) sent from the SPI Master.
Temperature is measured every second and sent by socket communication.

# How to use
## Environment
    * Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS
    * GCC 4.2.1

## How to use
Compile using Makefile.

There are two kinds of binaries generated by compiling.

    * s_e4adt7310
    * e4adt7310

s_e4adt 7310 (Simple_e 4 adt 7310) narrows down two types of command byte strings to be input, and outputs fixed temperature information.

e4adt 7310 interprets the command byte to be input and makes appropriate behavior.

## Execution
Grant execute privilege by chmod etc.

## Argument
A file descriptor for imitating SPI communication on Linux is required as an argument.

By default "/tmp/spi" is used and can be set to a free position by argument.

Example：
```
./e4adt7310 ~/spi00
```

- debug
In adt7310.h
```
#define PRINT_SOCK_COMM
```
is defined.

Use it according to your needs.

# Unimplemented ISSUE
- Function related to temperature generation (fixed value is set now, 0×0DC6 (27.547°C. at 16 bit resolution))
- Behavior when specifying configuration command

# Special Thunks
The library for the ADT 7310 used for the test environment is [scogswell/ArduinoADT 7310] (https://github.com/scogswell/ArduinoADT7310).
